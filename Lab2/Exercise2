    % (1) When m < n, a transformation T(x) = Ax 
    % Cannot be one-to-one because there are more variables than equations
    % which means there will be at least one free variable and the solution
    % will not be unique

    % (2) When m > n, a transformation T(x) = Ax 
    % Cannot be onto because the column vectors can't span entire codomain
    % so there will not be a solution for each b

    % (3) When m = n, a transformation T(x) = Ax 
    % T can be neither onto or one-to-one if some of the columns of A are
    % linearly dependent. This would fail to span the space and map
    % multiple domain vectors to the same codomain. 

    example_neither = [1, 2, 3; 2, 4, 6; 3, 6, 9]
    transform_neither = transformation(example_neither);

    % (4) When m = n, a transformation T(x) = Ax 
    % It is not possible for a linear transformation to be onto and not
    % one-to-one or one-to-one and not onto when a matrix is square 
    % because their properties are interconnected. If you have enough
    % columns to be one-to-one, you have a solution for each b in the
    % codomain. Inversely, if you have a solution for each b in the 
    % codomain (onto), it implies each column is unqiue and it is
    % one-to-one.
